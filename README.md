# Moved

This project has moved to, and merged with, [quinn](https://github.com/djc/quinn).

# quicr

quicr is an implementation of the [QUIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) network protocol [undergoing
standardization by the IETF](https://quicwg.github.io/). It is currently suitable for experimental use. The
implementation is split up into the state machine crate `quicr-core` which performs no IO internally and can be tested
deterministically, and a high-level tokio-compatible API in `quicr`. See `quicr/examples/` for usage.
